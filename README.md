My files from the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Udemy course by Al Sweigart.

I decided to do this course after finishing the beginner section of the 100 Days of Code: Complete Python Pro Bootcamp to help me revise the Python fundementals and basics before moving on to the more intermediate sections and challenges.

It was great to really drill down on the fundamentals and going over similar concepts from a different perspective and tutor was really beneficial to my learning.

It felt good to one hundo the course and this was a great motivation to take back straight back into the 100 Days of Code course! üòÅ
